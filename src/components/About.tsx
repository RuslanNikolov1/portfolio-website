              Outside of work, I am passionate about <strong>music</strong>. I produce electronic music across different genresâ€”techno, breakbeat, house, dub, drum and bass, psyâ€‘trance, tripâ€‘hop, ambient, but also jazz, funk, and bossa nova. I try to mix interesting melodies, beats and emotions, and try to keep it interesting at all times. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ruslan-nikolov-323139497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a>. I publish my own tracks independently, and the feedback that I receive is very positive. Favourite musicians: Thievery Corporation, Deadmau5, Flume, Calibre. Worth checking out. <strong>How this helps my development:</strong> Music production has taught me rhythm, timing, and flowâ€”essential for creating smooth animations and intuitive user interactions. My experience with audio software interfaces directly translates to designing better UX patterns and understanding user feedback systems.

              I also love doing <strong>sports</strong>. I have trained karate and volleyball when I was in school. At all times I have been parallely doing calisthenics and going to the gym, I am now mainly focused on basketball and crossfit and tableâ€‘tennis. The sportsmen I admire are Lionel Messi, Nikola Jokic (basketball), Stephen Curry, Raphael Nadal, Roger Federer, Simon Gauzy (table tennis). <strong>How this helps my development:</strong> Sports have taught me discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinkingâ€”crucial for project planning and collaboration. The competitive mindset drives me to continuously improve my code quality and stay updated with the latest frontend technologies.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              I also enjoy <strong>reading</strong>. I recently finished a great book by historian Yuval Noah Harari called <strong>Homo Deus</strong>. It&apos;s a story of mankind, its past, present and future in a very pleasant and engaging manner. It goes through all the important topics and it fills your knowledge gaps effortlessly. I started reading <strong>Homo Sapiens</strong>. It&apos;s by the same author, but it&apos;s more focused on the past of our species.
              My intellectual interests include <strong>psychology, philosophy and physics</strong>. I also love <strong>comedy</strong>, and some would say I even have a decent sense of humour. <strong>How this helps my development:</strong> Reading about psychology helps me understand user behavior and create more intuitive interfaces. Philosophy teaches me to think critically about design decisions, while physics knowledge aids in creating realistic animations and understanding performance optimization principles.

              Additionally I like good <strong>art</strong>. My favourite styles are impressionism, surrealism, fantasy and sci-fi. Favourite artists include: Impressionists: Claude Monet, Ã‰douard Manet; surrealists: Salvador Dali, ZdzisÅ‚aw BeksiÅ„ski, Alex Grey, Vladimir Kush; Sci-fi: Moebius. I have also drawn Greek and Roman capitals and explored color compositions. Furthermore I like going out with friends and socializing. I love walking in the centre and sea garden and visiting theatres. <strong>How this helps my development:</strong> My appreciation for art directly enhances my UI design skillsâ€”understanding color theory, composition, and visual hierarchy from studying great artists helps me create more aesthetically pleasing and effective user interfaces. The creative thinking from art appreciation translates to innovative problem-solving in frontend development.
